Hello fanatics, crazy russian dad here with you.
And guess what. I am going to jury duty.
Yes, I have received the summons and tomorrow I'm going to court.
Yes, I'm going to perform my civic duty as an american, okay.
This is a big deal for me. I have never done this in my life, okay, and you know what they say. Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others, okay, Churchill, somebody said that or maybe somebody said it before him. I don't actually know.
Of course all my friends and relatives are telling me here's how you get out of this, okay. They're suggesting certain strategies. They say tell them you don't speak English. And I figure, well, that shoudn't be hard, I just have to start talking.
Secondly, they're saying like, okay, tell them that you're crazy, okay, maybe just my mother and father had brief schizophrenia, but I'm totally okay.
And another friend suggested that I recommend some cruel and unusual punishment.
