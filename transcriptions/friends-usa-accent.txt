So so What do you want for lunch?
Oh I don't know.
I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do.
Um.
What's the matter?
I'm just bummed the way I left things with Ross.
I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Yeah. Don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married.
Still in love with?
Yeah.
I'm not in love with Ross.
Oh!
No, no! Good! Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross's wedding because he's my ex boyfriend.
and that would be really uncomfortable.
Not because I'm still in love with him. I mean, hey, you know I like Ross as much as any guy.
You know. Clearly, I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.
You know. I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross? You know, yeah!
But I have continuing feelings of love. But that doesn't mean that I'm still in love with him.
You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
Oh my god!
Oh my.
Why didn't you tell me?
We thought you knew?
We?
Yeah, we all know. We talk about it all the time.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Oh, I can't believe you didn't tell me!
Because we thought you knew. It's so obvious!
God! It would be like, you know, telling Monica
Hey, you know, you like things clean.
