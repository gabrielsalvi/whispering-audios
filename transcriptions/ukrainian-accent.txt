I want to tell you guys in this video and explain you how possible or not possible is it to find jobs in Ukraine for a foreigner.
I have lots of questions like this from a lot of people and I want to clear a lot of things out in this video so I have less messages about the same stuff.
So first of all guys, Ukraine is not an English speaking country and Ukraine do not need foreigners for jobs.
Because we don't have enough qualified jobs for locals.
Companies are not ready to make visa for you.
What visa I'm talking about. Companies here trying to cheat the current law here. They don't want to hire you officially.
They, for example, ask you to be entrepreneur. So as if you have a co working and you work independently.
And you expect to have some kind of official job permit and stuff like that.
That's not going to happen. You, if you don't know the local language which I think it's almost impossible to find a job here.
Who can find job here? If you are a foreigner and your company sends you to Ukraine, you have a special goal here or there's a special vacancy at english searching sites. That they need a native speaker, a foreigner, for example, to know the local market or connect your country's market and ukrainian market.
You don't need to look for the job vacancies on local sites. Even if you find English written vacancy, I found them. They just, you know, require people who know English. They don't need foreigners.
You can also be a teacher or a tutor here. As an English teacher it's very popular or any other native, any other language that you speak, that is native for you.
But it most likely they will not be ready to make a visa too. So, you need to find another way.
