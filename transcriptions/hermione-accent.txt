That's better isn't it?
Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter, I'm Hermione Granger. And you are?
I'm Ron Weasley.
Pleasure.
You two better change into robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.
Stop stop stop, you're going to take someone's eye out. Besides you're saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Liviosar.
You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Look at you playing with your cards.
Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
I'm ready! Ask me any question.
Alright, what's the three most crucial ingredients in a forgetfulness potion?
I forgot.
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
Copy off you?
No, you won't!
Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
Really really sorry about this. Petrificus Totalus!
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
Huh.
To the Shrieking Shack.
Oh, actually I'm fine.
That looks very painful.
So painful.
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!
Bloody hell.
Honestly, get dressed. And don't go back to sleep.
Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.
I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me!
And I said yes.
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks, Would you care to join us?
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
What's got your wand in a knot?
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?
Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation.
To make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
He's way too old.
What! What?
That's what you think?
Yeah, that's what I think.
You know the solution then, don't you?
Go on.
Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not as a last resort.
Well, that's... I mean, that's just completely off the point. Harry.
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed, both of you.
They get scary when they get older.
Ron, you spoiled everything.
What's this about?
Grope, put me down.
Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all.
Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing!
You... complete arse of, a Weasley!
You show up here after weeks and you say hey?
And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
My name.
Just my name.
Like a whisper.
How the ruddy. Undetectable Extension Charm.
You're amazing, you are.
Always the tone of surprise.
Here he is! He's just... Brilliant!
He just vanished.
Just now, I saw it.
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.
It doesn't show up on the map, does it? You said that last year.
That's right. I did.
Let's go.
Brilliant!
