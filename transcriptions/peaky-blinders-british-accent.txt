Right, boys, you're all here.
Today, this is my fucking wedding day.
Yeah, and you said there'd be no bloody uniforms.
Nevertheless... Nevertheless, John...
Despite the bad blood, I'll have none of it on my carpet.
Now for Grace's sake, nothing will go wrong.
Those bastards out there are her family.
And if you fuckers do anything to embarrass her, your kin, your cousins, your horses, your fucking kids, you do anything...
Tom?
To... What?
What about snow?
Yeah, their women are sports, I'll say that...
No. No. No.
No cocaine.
No cocaine. No sports.
No telling fortunes. No racing.
No fucking sucking petrol out of their fucking cars.
And, you, Charlie, stop spinning yarns about me, eh?
I'm just trying to sell you to them, Tom.
But the main thing is, you bunch of fuckers, despite the provocation from the cavalry, no fighting.
Roy. No fighting. No fucking fighting. No fighting.
No fucking fighting.
